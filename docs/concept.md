**Tagline:** The AI Agent That Actually Gets You

## Overview

Qlue is a revolutionary AI experience powered by an intelligent agent that dynamically builds comprehensive taste profiles in real-time. Unlike static AI systems, Qlue's agent actively discovers, analyzes, and connects your preferences across domains, feeding this rich intelligence to personalized video agents (Tavus) for conversations that feel genuinely human and deeply personal.

## The Breakthrough

**The Agent is the Engine.** Qlue's core innovation is an AI agent that treats taste discovery as an active investigation rather than a static profile. Armed with Qloo's cultural intelligence API as its toolkit, the agent dynamically:

* **Investigates** your preferences with strategic API calls
* **Discovers** hidden connections across taste domains  
* **Builds** comprehensive psychological and lifestyle profiles
* **Adapts** its strategy based on each discovery
* **Streams** insights in real-time to create engaging experiences
* **Feeds** rich contextual data to video agents for authentic interactions

## Agent-Powered Architecture

### The Intelligence Engine
```
User Input: "I love Taylor Swift, Joe Rogan, and Korean BBQ"

Agent Process:
🔍 "Let me investigate Taylor Swift fans..."
   → Qloo API: entity_search("Taylor Swift") 
🎵 "Interesting! Swift fans love indie folk. Let me explore..."
   → Qloo API: get_insights(swift_fans + indie_preferences)
🍽️ "Korean BBQ + Swift suggests adventurous palette..."
   → Qloo API: cross_domain_analysis(music_taste + food_preferences)
🧠 "Pattern emerging: high openness, social confidence..."
   → Builds psychological profile
📹 "Feeding rich context to video agent..."
   → Tavus Agent: Personalized conversation with deep understanding
```

### Dynamic Tool Utilization
The agent leverages Qloo API endpoints as intelligent tools:
* **Entity Resolution**: Find exact Qloo IDs for user preferences
* **Taste Analysis**: Discover what people with similar tastes enjoy
