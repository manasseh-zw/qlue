user -> get started -> chat with assistant to establish data points -> use data points to come up with a user taste profile via the agent which utilizes the qloo api exposed to it as tools and iteratively uses different combinations of the established datapoints to gain new insights until we have a solid grasp of the potential user preferences. (we might stream updates of as the agent is building up teh user taste profile to keep the user engaged as the agent discoveres tastes etc) after profile is built the user can start a conversation with one of our specialized live video agents which leverages the user taste profile to customize the experience, maybe 2 modes for now. Perfect Pitch(product pitch the customer is most likely to buy based on profile) , Perfect Date(where the user goes on a date with an ai assitant that knows him/her deeply!)
