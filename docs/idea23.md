# Algorithmic Taste Profile Building with Qloo

## From Sparse Data Points to Rich Cultural Intelligence

### Core Philosophy

Transform minimal user inputs into comprehensive taste profiles by:

1. **Entity Resolution** - Convert user inputs to Qloo entities
2. **Domain Expansion** - Find related content within each domain
3. **Cross-Domain Intelligence** - Discover taste patterns across domains
4. **Demographic Weighting** - Use age/gender to refine recommendations
5. **Personality Inference** - Extract psychological and lifestyle traits
6. **Continuous Refinement** - Build increasingly accurate profiles

## Algorithm Framework

### Phase 1: Entity Resolution & Initial Mapping

```
INPUT: Raw user data points
OUTPUT: Qloo entity IDs + confidence scores

For each user input:
1. searchEntities(input) → get Qloo entity_id
2. analyzeEntities([entity_id]) → extract core tags/characteristics
3. Map to broader categories (genre, themes, audience traits)
```

**Example: "Whitney Houston - All at Once"**

```
→ Entity: Whitney Houston (4BBEF799-A0C4-4110-AB01-39216993C312)
→ Tags: [R&B, Soul, Ballads, 80s, Emotional, Powerful Vocals]
→ Categories: [Classic R&B, Emotional Music, Retro Preferences]
```

### Phase 2: Domain-Specific Expansion Paths

## Qloo API Implementation Strategy

### 1. Initial Entity Resolution

```typescript
// Convert user inputs to Qloo entities
const resolveUserInputs = async (userData) => {
  const entities = [];

  // Music entities
  for (const track of userData.music) {
    const result = await searchEntities(track, { entityType: "artist" });
    entities.push(...result.results);
  }

  // Content entities
  for (const content of userData.booksShowsMovies) {
    const movieResult = await searchEntities(content, { entityType: "movie" });
    const bookResult = await searchEntities(content, { entityType: "book" });
    entities.push(...movieResult.results, ...bookResult.results);
  }

  return entities;
};
```

### 2. Domain Expansion Engine

```typescript
const expandDomain = async (coreEntities, domain) => {
  // Get similar entities within domain
  const similarEntities = await getArtistInsights({
    signals: {
      entities: coreEntities.map((e) => e.entity_id),
      demographics: { age: userData.age, gender: userData.gender },
    },
    options: { take: 20, explainability: true },
  });

  // Analyze taste patterns
  const tasteAnalysis = await analyzeEntities({
    entityIds: coreEntities.map((e) => e.entity_id),
    analysisType: "both",
  });

  return { similarEntities, tasteAnalysis };
};
```

### 3. Cross-Domain Discovery

```typescript
const discoverCrossDomainPatterns = async (allEntities, demographics) => {
  // Build comprehensive cross-domain profile
  const crossDomainProfile = await buildCrossDomainProfile({
    baseEntities: allEntities.map((e) => e.entity_id),
    demographics: demographics,
    take: 10,
  });

  // Compare with demographic averages
  const demographicComparison = await compareEntityGroups({
    group1: {
      entityIds: allEntities.map((e) => e.entity_id),
      label: "User Profile",
    },
    group2: {
      entityIds: await getTypicalEntitiesForDemographic(demographics),
      label: "Demographic Average",
    },
  });

  return { crossDomainProfile, demographicComparison };
};
```

### 4. Continuous Refinement Loop

```typescript
const refineProfile = async (currentProfile, newInteractions) => {
  // Weight recent interactions higher
  const weightedEntities = [
    ...currentProfile.entities.map((e) => ({ ...e, weight: 0.7 })),
    ...newInteractions.map((e) => ({ ...e, weight: 1.0 })),
  ];

  // Re-analyze with updated weights
  const refinedAnalysis = await analyzeTasteSimilarity({
    targetEntities: weightedEntities.map((e) => e.entity_id),
    candidateEntities: await getTrendingEntities({
      category: "all",
      take: 50,
    }),
    includeExplanation: true,
  });

  return refinedAnalysis;
};
```
